C# Book chapters 3 & 4.
    Chapter 5 if you've got the time.

Long-term Project: Blog Software
================================

Database will contain all posts.

Urls (the part after the .com):

    /
        Home.  Show the entire, most recent post.

    /post-nick-name
        Show the entire post that has this nick name.

    /Archives
        Show the date and title of all the posts, most recent on top.
        Group them by year and month, ie:

            2011
                December
                    Sample Title - December 10
                    Sample Title - December 09
                November
                    Sample Title - November 26

            2010
                etc...

    /2010
        If the url looks like a year, show the date and title of all posts from that year, most recen ton top.
        In other words, a part of the Archive page.

    /Admin
        This screen will require a login.  We can assume a single user.

        The admin screen allows the admin to delete any post, or create a new post.

Posts should have a title, url-friendly nickname, body text, and date/time of publication.

What to do about nicknames that look like years, etc?
    => Recommend for me a set of rules about what makes a good nickname, and how to generate one from a title.
       It should be valid URL characters, should be based on the title, and should not conflict with things like /2010, /Admin, /Archives...
